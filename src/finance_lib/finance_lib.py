Finance Lib

Description: The Finance Lib simplifies the management of your investments. It introduces two fundamental classes, Stock and StockValidator, designed to help you efficiently track and manage individual stock holdings.

The Stock class enables you to specify a stock symbol, start date, and end date for historical data. It will raise a ValueError if the symbol is invalid.

The StockValidator class is responsible for ensuring the validity of stock symbols within the Brazilian market. It also provides a handy list of Brazilian stock tickers for reference.

These core components of Finance Lib's streamline your portfolio management tasks, helping you make well-informed investment decisions.
